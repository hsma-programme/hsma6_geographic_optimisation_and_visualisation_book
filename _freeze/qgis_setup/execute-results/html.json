If so, click here to jump to the section on checking your version to ensure that the version you are running is suitable for the workshop.\n\nIf you are installing QGIS for the first time without using a software centre, head to this page - https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html - and click on the appropriate box for your operating system. The box may open automatically.\n\n![](images/qgis_install.png)\n\nWe would recommend going directly to this page rather than searching Google or Bing for QGIS as we know the link above is correct and you won't redirected to a third-party download site - using the link provided above ensures you are getting the software directly from the QGIS team.\n\nDon’t worry if the version number doesn’t exactly match the screenshots below - it will just automatically download the most recent release, which will be fine for the course.\n\nMore detailed instructions for Windows are given below.\n\n### Windows\nNote that installing the software will require administrator rights. If you are on a personal device this will not be a problem.\n\nIf you are installing it on your work device, please make sure you have gone through the appropriate processes with your IT department.\n\nClick on the green banner to download the installer.\n\n![](images/qgis_windows.png)\n\nThe download will take roughly 5 to 15 minutes, depending on the speed of your internet.\n\nWhen the installer has downloaded, find the file in the folder you saved it to, and double click on the file.\n\nFollow the instructions in the window that appears to install QGIS on your device.\n\nWhen you reach the step below, it may appear to pause for a long time with the progress bar not filling up.\n\n![](images/qgis_windows_setup.png)\n\nIf this happens, check your windows taskbar for the following icon:\n\n![](images/qgis_windows_account_control.png)\n\nThis is a pop-up for Windows user account control. You may need to click this and authorize the installer.\n\nThe process should then take a maximum of 10 minutes to complete.\n\n![](images/qgis_windows_install_complete.png)\n\nClick ‘Finish’. You should now be able to run QGIS from your start menu or an icon on your desktop.\n\nChecking the version of an existing QGIS install\n\nIf you are using an older version your organisation has approved, you may wish to check the version number.\n\nIf the version number is lower than 3.0, you may find the layout is a bit different to the version we use in the workshop.\n\nTo check the version this, open QGIS up, hover over ‘Help’ in the top menu bar, and then click ‘About’.\n\n![](images/qgis_existing_version_check_version.png)\n\nThe top line will tell you which version of QGIS you are currently running.\n\n![](images/qgis_existing_version_check_version_part_2.png)\n\nYou can also choose ‘Check QGIS Version’ from the same menu, but this isn’t quite as reliable!\n:::\n\n\n## Selecting panels\n\nWhen you open up QGIS for the first time, a few of the different panels you will need to use are hidden by default.\n\n![](images/qgis_blank.png)\n\n\n\nLet’s make sure we all have the same tools available\n\nClick **“View”** → **“Panels”**\n\nMake sure\n- “Browser”,\n- “Layer Styling”\n- and “Layers”\nall have a tick next to them\n\n![](images/qgis_panels.png)\n\nNow our QGIS should look a bit like this, with the panels highlighted in orange (browser, layer styling and layers) all visible on the screen.\n\n## Moving around QGIS\n\n![](images/qgis_panels_shown.png)\n\nTo move around your maps, you will need two key tools: move (pan) and zoom.\n\n![](images/qgis_panzoom.png)\n\nHowever, if you’re using a mouse with a scroll wheel, you can use that instead of the zoom buttons. The zoom will be centred around the point your mouse is hovering over, which can be useful for getting to a certain point quickly!\n\nOr on a laptop trackpad, you can “pinch” outwards to zoom out, and inwards to zoom in.\n\n## Starting a project\n\nNow you will want to start a new project.\n\nClick **\"Project\"** → **\"New\"**\n\n![](images/qgis_new_project.png)\n\nNow it's time to add our basemap - so head to the next chapter to find out how to do that.\n",
