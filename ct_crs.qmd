# Projections and Coordinate Reference Systems

Every map ever created is **wrong**.

A bold claim - but a true one! There is no way to take a spherical object like Earth and translate it to a flat object without compromising in some way.

The following video from Vox^[Video Credit - Vox, [Terms of Licence Use](https://www.voxmedia.com/pages/licensing)] is a great introduction to this concept, and gives you a nice overview of common `r glossary("projection", display="projections")` - different ways that people have tried to get around this problem over the years.

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIID5FDi2JQ >}}

## Projections

In summary, different projections are valuable for different reasons - but they can distort the sizes of countries quite significantly. Just how big these distortions are might surprise you...

For example, let's look at Greenland and Africa on the world map you are probably familiar with.


This map uses the Mercator projection.
Now, when our primary requirement for maps was trying to sail ships across the ocean, this map was fantastic. It allowed navigators to set a single constant bearing and get to where they needed to go, rather than constantly adjusting and risking huge errors if they made a single mistake along the way.

Actually, to be fair to the Mercator projection, it still has benefits today for navigation with things like Google maps - in fact, a special variant of the Mercator projection, known as Web Mercator (a.k.a. WGS 84 Web Mercator, WGS 84/Pseudo-Mercator, EPSG:3857) is used by almost every major web mapping service, such as Bing, OpenStreetMap, and others - so it's worth knowing about as you'll use it a lot when you're making interactive maps later in the course.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection]

However, all versions of the Mercator projection have the rather unfortunate side effect of significantly distorting the apparent sizes of different countries.

Countries **far** from the equator - for example Northern Europe, Russia, the US, Canada, and the North and South Poles - appear on the map to be much bigger than they are in reality. If you don't know it's happening, it can be quite a surprise to learn that certain countries really aren't as big as you might have thought!

### Optional Exercise {.unnumbered}

You can play around with some different projections at the [metrocosm website](http://metrocosm.com/compare-map-projections.html).

You will notice that there are a large number of purple dots all over the maps on that website. Why are they there?

On a globe, all of those purple dots would be the same size. They are a good way of understanding how different projections distort the size or shape of different parts of the world.

Look at each projection.

## Coordinate Reference Systems

The next thing to understand is how we divide the world up so we can all talk about it using the same language and find the same point on the map.

One of the most common ways to do this is with `r glossary("latitude")` and `r glossary("longitude")`.

### Latitude and longitude

**Latitude** looks at how far a point is from the equator - you can also think of it as how close a point is to the North or South Pole.

Lines of latitude run parallel with the equator.

![Latitude](images\crs_projections_latitude.png){.lightbox width=300}^[<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Latitude_and_Longitude_of_the_Earth_fr.svg">Djexplo</a>, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons]

Latitude has a value of 0 at the equator.

'Above' the equator - towards the North Pole - latitude gradually gets bigger, written as, for example, 70N, reaching a maximum of 90 North at the North pole.

'Below' the equator - towards the South Pole - latitude gradually gets bigger, but this time it is written as, for example, 45S reaching a maximum of 90 South at the South pole.

**However** - when you are using latitude on a computer, latitude South of the equator is often entered as a negative number instead.


**Longitude** is the horizontal distance of a point away from the prime Meridian - a particular line that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole through Greenwich, London.

![Longitude](images\crs_projections_longitude.png){.lightbox width=300}^[<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Latitude_and_Longitude_of_the_Earth_fr.svg">Djexplo</a>, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons]

Longitude has a value of 0 at the Prime Meridian (Greenwich).

East of the Prime Meridian, longitude gradually gets bigger and is written as, for example, 60E, reaching a maximum of 180 on directly the opposite side of Earth.

West of the Prime Meridian, longitude gradually gets bigger but this time it is written as, for example, 30W, reaching a maximum of 180 on directly the opposite side of Earth.

**However** - when you are using longitude on a computer, a longitude to the West of Greenwich is often entered as a negative number instead.


The image below gives you a quick reference to how different points may be written.

![](images\crs_projections_lat_long_cartesian.png)

#### Writing coordinate pairs

Any point in the world can be identified by providing a figure for both latitude and longitude.

However - it's important to write them in the correct order, else you will end up somewhere very different!

Now, just to be confusing... it's the opposite way around to a standard graph.

If you cast your mind back to school, you might remember being taught about writing a coordinate pair for a standard graph.

![A cartesian coordinate plane](images\crs_projections_cartesian_grid_comparison.png){.lightbox width=400 }

When we write this, we write the position of the horizontal point (x) first, and then the vertical (y) point - so we write coordinates as (x, y). So for the graph above, this means the coordinates are (2, 5). You might have been taught to remember this as going 'along the corridor, then up the stairs'.

Now... it's the opposite for latitude and longitude!

Let's say we have a latitude (the position vertically in relation to the equator - sort of equivalent to our y value above) of 7, and a longitude (the position horizontally in relation to the prime meridian - sort of equivalent to our x value above) of 15.

We'd write this as (7, 15) - *not* (15, 7) as you might have expected!

So just remember - it's the opposite order to a graph!


#### How do lines of latitude and longitude appear on different projections?

##### Mercator Projection {.unnumbered}

As it's the projection you're still going to commonly see (and probably use for most of the maps you create), let's go back to the Mercator map projection.

The lines of latitude and longitude are the white grid that's overlaid on the map, with the horizontal red line being the equator. Notice that all of the lines are totally straight!

![](images\Mercator_projection_Square.JPG){.lightbox width=600}

All of the lines of longitude (running top to bottom) are parallel to each other - that is they stay the same distance apart the whole time.

All of the lines of latitude (running left to right) are also parallel to each other.

The lines of latitude and longitude are at perfect right angles (also known as perpendicular) to each other.

Here, each horizontal line represents a distance of 15 degrees north or south.

However - if you look at the top of the map, you will notice that the lines get further and further apart - even though the gaps still represent 15 degrees.

Remember what we said before about the Mercator projection making countries further from the equator appear bigger than they are? Well this is it in action!

##### Gall-Peters Projection {.unnumbered}

In the Gall-Peters projection, the sizes of each rectangle made by the latitude and longitude lines are quite different to the Mercator proejction.

The rectangles are tall near the equator and get shorter as you go towards the North and South Poles.

![](images\Gall–Peters_projection_SW.jpg){.lightbox width=600}

However, like the Mercator projection, the lines of latitude are parallel to each other, and the same is true of the lines of longitude.

This means that the map can still be used to navigate with a constant bearing - unlike a projection where these lines are curved.

Gall-Peters maps are UNESCOs preferred map, and are quite common in UK schools.^[Higgins, Hannah B. The Grid Book. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2009. ISBN 9780262512404 p.94. "Embroiled in controversy from the start, the map is nonetheless widely used in the British school system and is promoted by the United Nations Educational and Scientific Cultural Organization (UNESCO) because of its ability to communicate visually the actual relative sizes of the various regions of the planet.", via Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall%E2%80%93Peters_projection]

##### Winkel Tripel {.unnumbered}

Finally, let's look at the lines on the Winkel tripel projection.

Nowadays, it's generally agreed that the Winkel Tripel is a projection that provides a nice balance between not distorting the countries further from the equator too much while also ensuring the shapes of each country are not distorted. It's used in a lot of textbooks and it's the preferred projection for world maps made by the National Geographic Society.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winkel_tripel_projection]

![](images\Winkel_triple_projection_SW.jpg){.lightbox width=600}

But notice that the lines of latitude and longitude are no longer straight!

#### Exercise: Getting Comfortable with Latitude and Longitude

It's helpful to get a bit of a feeling for how latitude and longitude is written, as you'll be dealing with it quite a lot in the datasets we will use later in this book.

So let's work through a couple of questions.

In each of the questions below
- the dotted line running vertically (from the top to the bottom of the image) is the **prime meridian** - the line that runs through Greenwich in London, England and is a longitude of 0.
- the dotted line running horizontally (from the left to the right of the image) is the **equator** - the line that is a latitude of 0.

)

    "Not quite! You've correctly identified that the latitude - the first number in the coordinate pair - is negative, as we are below the equator. However, as we're to the left of the prime meridian (the vertical line that goes through Greenwich in London, England), the second number in the coordinate pair - the longitude - will be negative too.",
    "Almost! You've the latitude - the first number in the coordinate pair - should be negative, as we are below the equator. However, you've got the second part of the coordinate pair (the longitude) correct - as we're to the left of the prime meridian (the vertical line that goes through Greenwich in London, England), the second number in the coordinate pair is negative too.",
    "Try again! The first number in the coordinate pair - the latitude - should be negative, as we are below the equator. Then as we're to the left of the prime meridian (the vertical line that goes through Greenwich in London, England), the second number in the coordinate pair - the longitude - will be negative too.",
    "Correct! The first number in the coordinate pair - the latitude - is negative, as we are below the equator.

feedback_japan <- c(
    "Try again! The first number in the coordinate pair - the latitude - should be positive, as we are above the equator.

    "Correct! The first number in the coordinate pair - the latitude - is positive, as we are above the equator. Then as we're to the right of the prime meridian (the vertical line that goes through Greenwich in London, England), the second number in the coordinate pair - the longitude - will be positive too.",
    "Almost! Have another look at the order of the numbers. Remember that unlike a graph, where we write the horizontal coordinate and then the vertical coordinate, when we are working with maps we write the latitude - the vertical coordinate - first, and then we write the longitude - the horizontal coordinate - second. Latitude only goes up to a maximum of 90 degrees, but the first number here is 138! However, you're right that both of the coordinates here are positive - we are above the equator and to the right of the prime meridian.",
    "Almost! You've correctly spotted that the first number in the coordinate pair - the latitude - should be positive, as we are above the equator. However, as we're to the right of the prime meridian (the vertical line that goes through Greenwich in London, England), the second number in the coordinate pair - the longitude - should be positive too.")

   "-3.51, 50.722"
)

feedback_stlukes <- c(
    "Not quite - we're above the equator (towards the North Pole), so the latitude will be positive. Also latitude will be written first - and because we're so close to the Prime Meridian, we'd expect latitude to be the smaller number here (quite close to zero). Have another go!",
    "I'm afraid that's not quite right! Remember, we're above the equator, so the first coordinate - the latitude - will be positive. Then as we're to the left of the prime meridian - the vertical line that goes through Greenwich in London, England - the longitude will be negative.",
    "Correct! Well done. The latitude is positive because we're above the equator, and the longitude is a small negative number as we are just to the left of the prime meridian.",
    "Not quite! You're correct that the first coordinate - the latitude - will be positive as we're above the equator. However, notice that we're to the left of the prime meridian - the vertical line that goes through Greenwich in London, England - so the longitude will be negative.",
    "Almost! Have a think about the size of the numbers. Remember that latitude - the distance from the equator - is written first, and goes from 0 at the equator to +- 180 at the poles. We're quite a long way up here, so we'd expect our figure for latitude to be a fairly large positive number. Then our longitude figure will be a fairly small negative number as we're only just to the left of the prime meridian (the vertical line that goes through Greenwich in London, England).")

## What coordinate reference systems are in use in the UK?


The UK government provides the following guidelines on the usage of coordinate reference systems:

>  - use British or Irish National Grid for data related to the UK and Northern Ireland
- use ETRS89 (EPSG::4258) for Europe
- use WGS84 for worldwide geographic location points

> You can also combine these standards and/or add other CRS to meet your organisation’s requirements, for example, when you need greater accuracy for precision engineering decisions.
