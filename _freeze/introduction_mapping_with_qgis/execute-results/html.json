It's used widely across both industry and the charity sector, and it's what we'll be using for this section.\n\nIf you are on the HSMA programme, it has been taught for several years, so it may have already been approved for installing in your organisation - check your organisation's software centre if you have one, or if it's on a list of approved software on your company IT portal.\n\nNow, GIS is just \"software that blends the power of a map with the power of a database to allow people to create, manage and analyse information, particularly information about location.\"^[Ordnance Survey](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/tools-support/gis/what-is-gis)\n\nIn later modules, we will explore how to do mapping from within Python, which will allow you to create 'static' maps (non-interactive images where you can control exactly how the final output looks), and 'interactive' maps (where a user can move around the map, zoom in or out, and interact with elements on the map to get more information). However, learning to create maps in Python doesn't make your QGIS knowledge redundant - it's a very powerful tool that is also accessible to those who don't know how to code.\n\n# References\n",
