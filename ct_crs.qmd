# Projections and Coordinate Reference Systems

Every map ever created is **wrong**.

A bold claim - but a true one! There is no way to take a spherical object like Earth and translate it to a flat object without compromising in some way.

The following video from Vox^[Video Credit - Vox, [Terms of Licence Use](https://www.voxmedia.com/pages/licensing)] is a great introduction to this concept, and gives you a nice overview of common `r glossary("projection", display="projections")` - different ways that people have tried to get around this problem over the years.

## Projections

In summary, different projections are valuable for different reasons - but they can distort the sizes of countries quite significantly. Just how big these distortions are might surprise you...

For example, let's look at Greenland and Africa on the world map you are probably familiar with.


This map uses the Mercator projection.
Now, when our primary requirement for maps was trying to sail ships across the ocean, this map was fantastic. It allowed navigators to set a single constant bearing and get to where they needed to go, rather than constantly adjusting and risking huge errors if they made a single mistake along the way.

Actually, to be fair to the Mercator projection, it still has benefits today for navigation with things like Google maps - it does give you a realistic idea of



However, it has the rather unfortunate side effect of significantly distorting the apparent sizes of different countries.

Countries **far** from the equator - for example Northern Europe, Russia, the US, Canada, and the North and South Poles - appear on the map to be much bigger than

### Optional Exercise 1

A great way to get your head around the impact of the Mercator projection on our understanding of the world is to use the website [the true size of](https://www.thetruesize.com/).

Try the following out. Do the results surprise you? Does this change your sense of our world?

### Optional Exercise 2

You can play around with some different projections at the [metrocosm website](http://metrocosm.com/compare-map-projections.html).

You will notice that there are a large number of purple dots all over the maps on that website. Why are they there?

On a globe, all of those purple dots would be the same size. They are a good way of understanding how different projections distort the size or shape of different parts of the world.

Look at each projection.

## Coordinate Reference Systems

The next thing to understand is how we divide the world up so we can all talk about it using the same language and find the same point on the map.

One of the most common ways to do this is with `r glossary("latitude")` and `r glossary("longitude")`.

### Latitude and longitude

**Latitude** looks at how far a point is from the equator - you can also think of it as how close a point is to the North or South Pole.

Lines of latitude run parallel with the equator.

![Latitude](images\crs_projections_latitude.png)^[<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Latitude_and_Longitude_of_the_Earth_fr.svg">Djexplo</a>, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons]

Latitude has a value of 0 at the equator.

'Above' the equator - towards the North Pole - latitude gradually gets bigger, written as, for example, 70N, reaching a maximum of 90 North at the North pole.

'Below' the equator - towards the South Pole - latitude gradually gets bigger, but this time it is written as, for example, 45S reaching a maximum of 90 South at the South pole.

**However** - when you are using latitude on a computer, latitude South of the equator is often entered as a negative number instead.


**Longitude** is the horizontal distance of a point away from the prime Meridian - a particular line that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole through Greenwich, London.

![Longitude](images\crs_projections_longitude.png)^[<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Latitude_and_Longitude_of_the_Earth_fr.svg">Djexplo</a>, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons]

Longitude has a value of 0 at the Prime Meridian (Greenwich).

East of the Prime Meridian, longitude gradually gets bigger and is written as, for example, 60E, reaching a maximum of 180 on directly the opposite side of Earth.

West of the Prime Meridian, longitude gradually gets bigger but this time it is written as, for example, 30W, reaching a maximum of 180 on directly the opposite side of Earth.

**However** - when you are using longitude on a computer, a longitude to the West of Greenwich is often entered as a negative number instead.


#### Writing coordinate pairs

Any point in the world can be identified by providing a figure for both latitude and longitude.

However - it's important to write them in the correct order, else you will end up somewhere very different!

Now, just to be confusing... it's the opposite way around to a standard graph.

If you cast your mind back to school, you might remember being taught about writing a coordinate pair for a standard graph.

![A cartesian coordinate plane](images\crs_projections_cartesian_grid_comparison.png)

When we write this, we write the position of the horizontal point (x) first, and then the vertical (y) point - so we write coordinates as (x, y). So for the graph above, this means the coordinates are (2, 5). You might have been taught to remember this as going 'along the corridor, then up the stairs'.

Now... it's the opposite for latitude and longitude!

Let's say we have a latitude (the position vertically in relation to the equator - sort of equivalent to our y value above) of 7, and a longitude (the position horizontally in relation to the prime meridian - sort of equivalent to our x value above) of 15.

We'd write this as (7, 15) - *not* (15, 7) as you might have expected!

So just remember - it's the opposite order to a graph!

#### How do lines of latitude and longitude appear on different projections?

As it's the projection you're still going to commonly see (and probably use for most of the maps you create), let's go back to the Mercator map projection.

The lines of latitude and longitude are the white grid that's overlaid on the map. Notice that they're totally straight!

![Mercator Projection](images\Mercator_projection_Square.JPG)

All of the lines of longitude (running top to bottom) are parallel to each other - that is they stay the same distance apart the whole time.

All of the lines of latitude (running left to right) are also parallel to each other.

The lines of latitude and longitude are at perfect right angles (also known as perpendicular) to each other.

Here, each horizontal line represents a distance of 15 degrees north or south.

However - if you look at the top of the map, you will notice that the


#### Exercise: Getting Comfortable with Latitude and Longitude

It's helpful to get a bit of a feeling for how latitude and longitude is written, as you'll be dealing with it quite a lot in the datasets we will use later in this book.

So let's work through a couple of questions.

##### Question 1 {.unnumbered}

![What are the correct coordinates for this restaurant in Colombia?](images\crs_projections_q_restaurant.png)

```{r echo = FALSE}
opts_restaurant <- c(
    "-19.059, 44.2",
   "19.059, -44.2",
   "19.059, 44.2",
   answer="-19.059, -44.2"
)

feedback_restaurant <- c(
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "")
```

`r longmcq(opts_restaurant, feedback_restaurant)`


##### Question 2 {.unnumbered}

![What are the correct coordinates for this national park in Japan?](images\crs_projections_q_national_park_japan.png)

```{r echo = FALSE}
opts_japan <- c(
    "-35.943, -138.764",
    answer="35.943, 138.764",
   "138.764, 35.943",
   "35.943, -138.764"
)

feedback_japan <- c(
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "")
```

`r longmcq(opts_japan, feedback_japan)`



##### Question 3 {.unnumbered}

![What are the correct coordinates for St Luke's?](images\crs_projections_q_st_lukes.png)

```{r echo = FALSE}
opts_stlukes <- c(
    "-3.51, -50.722",
   "-50.722, 3.51",
   answer = "50.722, -3.51",
   "50.722, 3.51",
   "-3.51, 50.722"
)

feedback_stlukes <- c(
    "Not quite - we're above the equator (towards the North Pole), so the latitude will be positive. Also latitude will be written first - and because we're so close to the Prime Meridian, we'd expect latitude to be the smaller number here (quite close to zero). Have another go!",
    "",
    "Correct! Well done.",
    "",
    "")
```

`r longmcq(opts_stlukes, feedback_stlukes)`


## What coordinate reference systems are in use in the UK?


The UK government provides the following guidelines on the usage of coordinate reference systems:

>  - use British or Irish National Grid for data related to the UK and Northern Ireland
- use ETRS89 (EPSG::4258) for Europe
- use WGS84 for worldwide geographic location points

> You can also combine these standards and/or add other CRS to meet your organisation’s requirements, for example, when you need greater accuracy for precision engineering decisions.
