They want to keep fuel costs down and use as few vehicles as possible - so optimizing the route of each vehicle is crucial.\n\nNow, while health systems certainly have inventory and delivery problems, there are other kinds of resources that are often travelling - nurses.\n\nCommunity nursing is a huge part of the NHS. In acute (physical) trusts, nurses may be visiting the homes of clients to change dressings, conduct health checks, administer medication, and more.\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart LR\n    id1{{\"Beryl can’t do leg dressing changes for patients at the moment because she has a bad back\"}}\n\n    id2{{\"Mr H only wants male nurses for the catheter change\"}}\n\n    id3{{\"We need two nurses for that visit\"}}\n\n    id4{{\"There are roadworks on Quarry lane for the next three weeks so it’s taking 20 minutes extra to get between visits\"}}\n\n    id5{{\"Matt hasn’t done his insulin pump training yet\"}}\n```\n\n\n\nCommunity transport problems are another class of routing problem in the NHS.\nPatients are sometimes unable to get themselves to crucial appointments by driving or public transport, meaning transport vehicles are necessary to ensure they can attend critical appointements such as dialysis.\n\n[PUT IN COVID DIALYSIS TRANSPORT EXAMPLE]\n\nIn other situations, such as mental health trusts, there may be a requirement to securely transport patients from their home to a ward for inpatient treatment, or between wards with different levels of security or treatment intensity.\n\nThis is before we start to consider things such as paramedic cars and ambulances, where the location and movement of vehicles is crucial.\n",
