Designed for computer programmers to utilise when writing programs rather than being used by an end user.\n\nYou will send a request to an API and it will send back a response. For example, you might request data on the postcode EX2 5AA from the postcodes.io API, and it will return a text string containing data like the latitude and longitude."

They want to keep fuel costs down and use as few vehicles as possible - so optimizing the route of each vehicle is crucial.\nNow, while health systems certainly have inventory and delivery problems, there are other kinds of resources that are often travelling - nurses.\nCommunity nursing is a huge part of the NHS.

    "text": "2.1 Example Questions\n\n2.1.1 Fill-In-The-Blanks (fitb())\nCreate fill-in-the-blank questions using fitb(), providing the answer as the first argument.\n\n2 + 2 is \n\nYou can also create these questions dynamically, using variables from your R session.\n\nThe square root of 25 is: \n\nThe blanks are case-sensitive; if you don’t care about case, use the argument ignore_case = TRUE.\n\nWhat is the letter after D? \n\nIf you want to ignore differences in whitespace use, use the argument ignore_ws = TRUE (which is the default) and include spaces in your answer anywhere they could be acceptable.\n\nHow do you load the tidyverse package? \n\nYou can set more than one possible correct answer by setting the answers as a vector.\n\nType a vowel: \n\nYou can use regular expressions to test answers against more complex rules.\n\nType any 3 letters: \n\nYou can provide feedback that will appear when an incorrect answer is typed in.\n\nWhat is 1 + 3 x 2: \n\nHowever, where the answer is longer than 1 letter, you may wish to use it in conjunction with the ‘checked sections’ function (see below) to prevent the feedback from being displayed prematurely.\n\nType in the word ‘long’: \n\n\n\n2.1.2 Multiple Choice (mcq())\n\n“Never gonna give you up, never gonna: let you goturn you downrun awaylet you down”\n“I bless the rainsguess it rainssense the rain down in Africa” -Toto\n\nYou can also optionally pass a vector of feedback to the multiple choice question. The feedback will appear below the box when an answer is selected.\n\nWhat is 20 - 2 x 4? 7212\n\nIf present, the feedback vector must be the same length as the options vector and the order must match up with the order of the options vector. However, you can pass an empty string “” if you don’t want any feedback to show for certain options.\n\nWhat has changed in the year 3000? Not much, but they live underwaterEverythingNothing - I can’t believe they don’t have hoverboards yet\n\n\n\n2.1.3 True or False (torf())\n\nTrue or False? You can permute values in a vector using sample(). TRUEFALSE\n\nYou can also add feedback to True or False questions. To do this, just pass in a vector of feedback - the first item is the feedback for the ‘TRUE’ option, and the second is for the ‘FALSE’ option.\nTrue or False? The month of April has 31 days. TRUEFALSE\n\n\n2.1.4 Longer MCQs (longmcq())\nWhen your answers are very long, sometimes a drop-down select box gets formatted oddly. You can use longmcq() to deal with this. Since the answers are long, It’s probably best to set up the options inside an R chunk with echo=FALSE.\nWhat is a p-value?\n\n the probability that the null hypothesis is true the probability of the observed, or more extreme, data, under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true the probability of making an error in your conclusion\n\nYou can also add feedback to long multiple choice questions.\n\n the probability that the null hypothesis is true the probability of the observed, or more extreme, data, under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true the probability of making an error in your conclusion\n\nWhat is true about a 95% confidence interval of the mean?\n\n 95% of the data fall within this range there is a 95% probability that the true mean lies within this range if you repeated the process many times, 95% of intervals calculated in this way contain the true mean\n\nNot every option needs to have feedback - but you need to pass an empty string so that the feedback vector is the same length as the options vector. If randomising the order, you need to make sure you apply the same ordering to the opts and feedback vectors.\n\n if you repeated the process many times, 95% of intervals calculated in this way contain the true mean 95% of the data fall within this range there is a 95% probability that the true mean lies within this range"
