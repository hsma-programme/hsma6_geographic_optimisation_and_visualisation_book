You can permute values in a vector using sample(). TRUEFALSE\n\nYou can also add feedback to True or False questions. To do this, just pass in a vector of feedback - the first item is the feedback for the ‘TRUE’ option, and the second is for the ‘FALSE’ option.\nTrue or False? The month of April has 31 days. TRUEFALSE\n\n\n2.1.4 Longer MCQs (longmcq())\nWhen your answers are very long, sometimes a drop-down select box gets formatted oddly. You can use longmcq() to deal with this.

    "text": "4.1 Projections\nIn summary, different projections are valuable for different reasons - but they can distort the sizes of countries quite significantly. Just how big these distortions are might surprise you…\nFor example, let’s look at Greenland and Africa on the world map you are probably familiar with.\nThis map uses the Mercator projection. Now, when our primary requirement for maps was trying to sail ships across the ocean, this map was fantastic. It allowed navigators to set a single constant bearing and get to where they needed to go, rather than constantly adjusting and risking huge errors if they made a single mistake along the way.\nActually, to be fair to the Mercator projection, it still has benefits today for navigation with things like Google maps - in fact, a special variant of the Mercator projection, known as Web Mercator (a.k.a. WGS 84 Web Mercator, WGS 84/Pseudo-Mercator, EPSG:3857) is used by almost every major web mapping service, such as Bing, OpenStreetMap, and others - so it’s worth knowing about as you’ll use it a lot when you’re making interactive maps later in the course.2\nHowever, all versions of the Mercator projection have the rather unfortunate side effect of significantly distorting the apparent sizes of different countries.\nCountries far from the equator - for example Northern Europe, Russia, the US, Canada, and the North and South Poles - appear on the map to be much bigger than they are in reality. If you don’t know it’s happening, it can be quite a surprise to learn that certain countries really aren’t as big as you might have thought!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to show an animation demonstrating the impact of the Mercator Projection on the relative size of different countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative Size of Countries - Mercator Projection Distortion\n\n\nBy Jakub Nowosad - Own Work;, CC BY-SA 4.0, Link3\n\n\n\n\nOptional Exercise\nA great way to get your head around the impact of the Mercator projection on our understanding of the world is to use the website the true size of.\nTry the following out. Do the results surprise you? Does this change your sense of our world? Click ‘clear map’ after each exercise to get back to a blank map, or right click on the coloured shape of the country to remove it - Search for Russia and drag it onto the North of Africa. - Search for the United Kingdom and drag it onto Greenland. - Search for Canada and drag it onto Brazil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the website without leaving the book!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Exercise\nYou can play around with some different projections at the metrocosm website.\nYou will notice that there are a large number of purple dots all over the maps on that website. Why are they there?\nOn a globe, all of those purple dots would be the same size. They are a good way of understanding how different projections distort the size or shape of different parts of the world.\nLook at each projection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the website without leaving the book!"

    "section": "4.2 Coordinate Reference Systems",
    "text": "4.2 Coordinate Reference Systems\nThe next thing to understand is how we divide the world up so we can all talk about it using the same language and find the same point on the map.\nOne of the most common ways to do this is with latitude and longitude.\n\n4.2.1 Latitude and longitude\nLatitude looks at how far a point is from the equator - you can also think of it as how close a point is to the North or South Pole.\nLines of latitude run parallel with the equator.\n4\nLatitude has a value of 0 at the equator.\n‘Above’ the equator - towards the North Pole - latitude gradually gets bigger, written as, for example, 70N, reaching a maximum of 90 North at the North pole.\n‘Below’ the equator - towards the South Pole - latitude gradually gets bigger, but this time it is written as, for example, 45S reaching a maximum of 90 South at the South pole.\nHowever - when you are using latitude on a computer, latitude South of the equator is often entered as a negative number instead.\nLongitude is the horizontal distance of a point away from the prime Meridian - a particular line that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole through Greenwich, London.\n5\nLongitude has a value of 0 at the Prime Meridian (Greenwich).\nEast of the Prime Meridian, longitude gradually gets bigger and is written as, for example, 60E, reaching a maximum of 180 on directly the opposite side of Earth.\nWest of the Prime Meridian, longitude gradually gets bigger but this time it is written as, for example, 30W, reaching a maximum of 180 on directly the opposite side of Earth.\nHowever - when you are using longitude on a computer, a longitude to the West of Greenwich is often entered as a negative number instead.\nThe image below gives you a quick reference to how different points may be written.\n\n\n4.2.1.1 Writing coordinate pairs\nAny point in the world can be identified by providing a figure for both latitude and longitude.\nHowever - it’s important to write them in the correct order, else you will end up somewhere very different!\nNow, just to be confusing… it’s the opposite way around to a standard graph.\nIf you cast your mind back to school, you might remember being taught about writing a coordinate pair for a standard graph.\n\n\n\nA cartesian coordinate plane\n\n\nWhen we write this, we write the position of the horizontal point (x) first, and then the vertical (y) point - so we write coordinates as (x, y). So for the graph above, this means the coordinates are (2, 5). You might have been taught to remember this as going ‘along the corridor, then up the stairs’.\nNow… it’s the opposite for latitude and longitude!\nLet’s say we have a latitude (the position vertically in relation to the equator - sort of equivalent to our y value above) of 7, and a longitude (the position horizontally in relation to the prime meridian - sort of equivalent to our x value above) of 15.\nWe’d write this as (7, 15) - not (15, 7) as you might have expected!\nSo just remember - it’s the opposite order to a graph!\n\n\n4.2.1.2 How do lines of latitude and longitude appear on different projections?\n\nMercator Projection\nAs it’s the projection you’re still going to commonly see (and probably use for most of the maps you create), let’s go back to the Mercator map projection.\nThe lines of latitude and longitude are the white grid that’s overlaid on the map, with the horizontal red line being the equator. Notice that all of the lines are totally straight!\n\n\n\nMercator Projection\n\n\nAll of the lines of longitude (running top to bottom) are parallel to each other - that is they stay the same distance apart the whole time.\nAll of the lines of latitude (running left to right) are also parallel to each other.\nThe lines of latitude and longitude are at perfect right angles (also known as perpendicular) to each other.\nHere, each horizontal line represents a distance of 15 degrees north or south.\nHowever - if you look at the top of the map, you will notice that the lines get further and further apart - even though the gaps still represent 15 degrees.\nRemember what we said before about the Mercator projection making countries further from the equator appear bigger than they are? Well this is it in action!\n\n\nGall-Peters Projection\nIn the Gall-Peters projection, the sizes of\n\n\n\nGall-Peters Projection\n\n\nGall-Peters maps are UNESCOs preferred map, and are quite common in UK schools.6\n\n\nWinkel Tripel\nFinally, let’s look at the lines on the Winkel tripel projection.\nNowadays, it’s generally agreed that the Winkel Tripel is a projection that provides a nice balance between not distorting the countries further from the equator too much while also ensuring the shapes of each country are not distorted. It’s used in a lot of textbooks and it’s the preferred projection for world maps made by the National Geographic Society.7\n\n\n\nWinkel Tripel Projection\n\n\nBut notice that the lines of latitude and longitude are no longer straight!\n\n\n\n4.2.1.3 Exercise: Getting Comfortable with Latitude and Longitude\nIt’s helpful to get a bit of a feeling for how latitude and longitude is written, as you’ll be dealing with it quite a lot in the datasets we will use later in this book.\nSo let’s work through a couple of questions.\nIn each of the questions below - the dotted line running vertically (from the top to the bottom of the image) is the prime meridian - the line that runs through Greenwich in London, England and is a longitude of 0. - the dotted line running horizontally (from the left to the right of the image) is the equator - the line that is a latitude of 0.\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\n\nWhat are the correct coordinates for this national park in Brazil?\n\n\n\n -20.655, 49.205 20.655, -49.205 20.655, 49.205 -20.655, -49.205\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\n\nWhat are the correct coordinates for this national park in Japan?\n\n\n\n -35.943, -138.764 35.943, 138.764 138.764, 35.943 35.943, -138.764\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\n\nWhat are the correct coordinates for St Luke’s?\n\n\nSt Luke’s is part of the University of Exeter and is home to the PenCHORD team, who write the HSMA course!\n\n -3.51, -50.722 -50.722, 3.51 50.722, -3.51 50.722, 3.51 -3.51, 50.722"

This is where the geopandas library comes in.\nPandas takes multiple series of data and joins these together to make a DataFrame. TODO: EXPAND THIS SECTION\nGeopandas takes the Series object of pandas and expands it to be able to deal with point, line or polygon data.\nIt adds in an ability to read various geographic data formats too, such as ESRI shapefiles, eopackages and geojson.\nThe magic of geopandas starts to become apparent when you need to filter and aggregate\nYou can even visualise geographic data that’s stored in a geopandas geodataframe with a single command: .plot()!\nIf you’re familiar with pandas, the good news is that working with geopandas will feel almost the same!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA warning about geopandas\n\n\n\nGeopandas is known for compatability issues with other packages.\nIf you install it into your base python environment, you may begin to experience odd behaviour or have issues [TODO: expand this section and get references]"
