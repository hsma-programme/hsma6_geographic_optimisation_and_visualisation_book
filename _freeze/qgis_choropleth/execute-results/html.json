So we can just click ‘Add’\n\nYou will now see a number of area boundaries, but at the moment, they are all the same colour - which isn’t much use!\n\n![](assets/2024-06-18-22-40-15.png)\n\n## Adding colour to our choropleths\n\nPreviously we were working with data that had a certain number of categories per value.\n\nHowever, if we take a look at the attribute table for this layer, we can see we have numeric values - so instead we want a graduated symbology.\n\nThis means values will be grouped together rather than having a separate category per value.\n\nThis is just a quick overview of the dataset in this section, opened up within QGIS. Notice that there is a row per LSOA, and some relevant counts for that LSOA stored in the later columns.\n\n![](assets/2024-06-18-22-40-56.png)\n\nNow we need to head to our layer styling panel. Where it says 'no symbol', click in the box and choose 'graduated'.\n\n![](assets/2024-06-18-22-41-16.png)\n\nLike before, we need to choose the value we want to colour our areas by.\n\nWe’ve got quite a lot to choose from in this dataset.\n\nLet’s start by looking at Shoplifting.\n\nTo do this, we need to click on the small arrow at the far right-hand side of the 'values' box.\n\n![](assets/2024-06-18-22-43-47.png)\n\nOnce we've selected this, click the 'classify' button (if it does not automatically populate the white box with a series of colours and category boundaries).\n\nWe now have our areas coloured by the number of shoplifting incidents.\nWhat do you notice about the categories it has set up for us?\n\n![](assets/2024-06-18-22-44-22.png)\n\n## Adjusting category boundaries and the number of categories in QGIS\n\n### Number of categories\n\nFirst, let’s experiment with the number of categories and see if that helps.\n\nWe can change this using the arrows next to the 'classes' box, or by typing in the number of classes we would like.\n\n![](assets/2024-06-18-22-45-20.png)\n\nThis can produce some odd behaviour when a lot of our groups have a very low number of values in!\n\nWe seem to have multiple categories for '0', each with a slightly different colour. That's not ideal behaviour - though depending on your dataset, this might not occur, and the default categorisation method may work fine, in which case you can just play around with the number of classes.\n\n### Categorisation type\n\nLet’s now try changing the classification mode.\n\nThis adjusts the algorithm used by QGIS to work out the size of each category and where the boundary will be.\n\nClick in the 'mode' box.\n\nYou can see there are several options to choose from.\n\nLet’s try ‘equal interval’\n\n![](assets/2024-06-18-22-48-06.png)\n\n![](assets/2024-06-18-22-48-35.png)\n\nThis looks very different - is this a good option?\n\n![](assets/2024-06-18-22-49-04.png)\n\nHere, while our categories now are of consistent *width* (i.e. the number of values they encompass is the same), due to the way the values in this dataset are distributed - with a lot of low values and only a handful of higher ones - the map is quite hard to interpret again.\n\nSo a small change to the mode led to a large change in our legend!\n\n![](assets/2024-06-18-22-50-43.png)\n\n\n## Hiding categories\n\nLike with our categorised point data, we can untick layers in the layer styling panel to just show certain categories.\n\n![](assets/2024-06-18-22-51-29.png)\n\n## Changing the Colourscheme\n\n![](assets/2024-06-18-22-52-00.png)\n\n## Viewing the Distribution\n\nIf you go to ‘histogram’ and click ‘load values’, you will see the distribution of the values in the column you’re visualising, along with vertical lines showing the boundary of each category.\n\nThis can be really helpful for understanding the distribution of your data…\n\n… but sometimes, like this, it’s really hard to see!\n\n![](assets/2024-06-18-22-52-55.png)\n",
