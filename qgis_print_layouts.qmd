# Print Layouts in QGIS
```{r, echo = FALSE}

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

```

There are quite a few ways to export your map.

## Simple exports

On Windows, you can use the snipping tool.

- On windows 10, use ðŸªŸ+ Shift + S to open the snipping tool.
- On windows 11, use the `prt sc` key

You can also export the in-view portion of the map as either an image or a PDF

## Print Layouts - why bother?

If you want to include a title, legends, or multiple maps on one page from within QGIS, you will need to create a print layout.

We can build up to a map that shows multiple useful things.

## Creating a new print layout

Choose project --> New print layout.

You can have multiple print layouts per map, so itâ€™s a good idea to give it a descriptive title

The print layout will open as a new window.

## Adding in a map

First you will want to add a map by clicking on this icon in the list down the side.

These icons are key for moving around in your map and selecting elements of your print layout.

## Legends

You may next want to add a legend.

Like before, draw the legend onto the canvas.

:::{.callout-tip}
With the legend selected on the canvas, you can choose â€˜Only show items from inside linked mapsâ€™ to remove any parts of the legend that donâ€™t relate to what is shown on the screen.

## Labels and Titles

You may want to add labels or titles.

![](assets/2024-06-18-23-26-45.png)

The contents has to be edited using the label box in the â€˜item propertiesâ€™ section.

You can adjust the font size by clicking on the â€˜Fontâ€™ box inside the â€˜Appearanceâ€™ section.

Once you have one label, you can copy and paste this to speed up creating additional labels.

## Attribution

If using the OpenStreetMap basemap that is built into QGIS, add a label like the following to comply with the licence:

Â© OpenStreetMap contributors, licenced as CC BY-SA

It is also good practice to acknowledge the software with a label like
Created in QGIS

## Extending your print layouts further

There are a range of additional things you can add to your print layouts, like

- images (perhaps the logo of your organisation)
- tables of relevant data

## Exporting print layouts

From within the print layout window, we can choose the "Layout" dropdown menu to find several different formats we can export our print layout in.
