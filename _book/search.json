Designed for computer programmers to utilise when writing programs rather than being used by an end user.\n\nYou will send a request to an API and it will send back a response. For example, you might request data on the postcode EX2 5AA from the postcodes.io API, and it will return a text string containing data like the latitude and longitude."

They want to keep fuel costs down and use as few vehicles as possible - so optimizing the route of each vehicle is crucial.\nNow, while\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    id1{{\"Beryl can’t do leg dressing changes for patients at the moment because she has a bad back\"}}\n\n    id2(\"Mr H only wants male nurses for the catheter change\")\n\n    id3{{\"We need two nurses for that visit\"}}\n\n    id4({\"There are roadworks on Quarry lane for the next three weeks so it’s taking 20 minutes extra to get between visits\"})\n\n    id5{{\"Matt hasn’t done his insulin pump training yet\"}}"
