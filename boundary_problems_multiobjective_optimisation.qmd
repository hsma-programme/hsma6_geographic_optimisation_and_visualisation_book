title: "(Coming Soon) Boundary Problems - Evaluating Solutions on Multiple Metrics"
format: html
---

So far, we have just been evaluating our solutions on a single critiera - the balance of a

However, we will often want to evaluate our solutions on multiple metrics. Some of these may be more important to us than others, so we will want a way to *weight* the resulting values when considering the overall score of a solution.

First, we'll explore building some additional metrics into our current example, and then we will move on to building functions that allow us to evaluate a solution flexibly based on some or all of these metrics.
